Default Relation Ranges:
  self:          1.0  to  1.0
  member:        0.1  to  1.0
  friend:        0.01 to  1.0
  neutral:      -0.01 to  0.01
  enemy:        -1.0  to -0.01
  killmilitary: -1.0  to -0.1
  kill:         -1.0  to -0.32
  nemesis:      -1.0  to -1.0

UI value mapping (analogously for negative values):
  1.0       = 30
  0.32      = 25
  0.1       = 20
  0.032     = 15
  0.01      = 10
  0.0032    = 5
These values are fixed. Between them, logarithmic interpolation is used. Approximate formulas:
  uivalue = 10 * log10(relation * 1000)
  relation = 10^(uivalue / 10) / 1000
Between -0.0032 and +0.0032 (UI -5...+5) linear interpolation is used, and 0.00064 equates to one UI value step.

Note: Relations defined here apply only to gamestart. Relations may change through gameplay and/or plot.
