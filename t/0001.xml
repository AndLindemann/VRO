 <t id="1001">Impulse Ray Emitter</t>
 <t id="1005">IRE</t>
 <t id="1002">This is a basic laser that is used in many light weapons and smaller fighter craft. It has an extremely high fire rate, is very light, and is an excellent weapon for missile defence purposes in turrets. The Impulse Ray Emitter is one of the oldest energy based weapons around. They require not much power to fire, and they usually have quite a rapid fire rate. No one actually knows when the weapon was first developed. </t>

 <t id="1012">A weapon found in some medium and large fighters. The first of its class were developed by the Paranid and Argon. The Particles are accelerated to a speed faster than nearly most currently known spacecraft. When they are then polarised and focused into a tight energy pulse. They have been around since the Xenon conflict. </t>

<t id="1103">HEPT</t>
<t id="1104">A weapon found in many medium to larger fighter craft. The radiation is so dangerous that the weapon had to go through many years of research and development until it could be placed on the market. This was worked around by adding a radiation sink into the weapon's main design. Purging the weapon of all excess radiation between shots.</t>
<t id="1111">ARG Photon Pulse Cannon</t>
<t id="1112">ARG Photon Pulse Cannon</t>
<t id="1113">PPC</t>
<t id="1114">A deadly weapon found on frigates, destroyers and carriers. First developed by Professor Jo Bydnah of the Argon, the Photon Pulse Cannon became a favourite of the argon Military, who then sold the original designs on to the other races. This type of weapon is extremely powerful, and can only be fitted on the larger Capital craft. It works by sending highly charged photon radiation through a series of coils, that multiplies the charge, creating a very deadly pulse of radiation.</t>

<t id="1122">Energy Bolt Chaingun</t>
<t id="1123">EBC</t>
<t id="1124">This laser is used in larger weapon systems and by many small to medium fighters. The Energy Bolt Chaingun was designed by the Teladi as an ammo-based alternative to the energy-hungry HEPT and PBE. It fires "bolts" of stored energy designed to damage enemy ships as effectively as any energy or plasma based weapon, while putting less strain on the ship's generator. This weapon requires special ammunition. </t>

<t id="1134">The Concussion Impulse Generator uses advanced technology to create powerful ripples in subspace. These bursts are strong enough to physically move objects and the high energy levels can drain shielding and cause moderate structural damage. </t>

<t id="1144">A deadly weapon found on destroyers and carriers. The Teladi designed this low-tech solution in a bid to save money on expensive capital ship energy generators. The Gauss Cannon uses magnetic coils to accelerate large ionised metallic slugs that, while too big to pass through them, will disrupt enemy shields.</t>
